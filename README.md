Installing + developing
-----------------------

Boxed View is currently under heavy development, so the install process isn't as nice as other Boxee apps. Working on it!

Boxed View has only been tested + developed on OS X. To install:

    git clone git://github.com/auxesis/boxed-view.git
    cd boxed-view
    rake install

Now launch Boxee from the dock, or from the terminal:

    /Applications/Boxee.app/Contents/MacOS/Boxee

In Boxee, navigate to applications, and launch Boxed View.
